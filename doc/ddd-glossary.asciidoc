| universe
| The sandbox for history to take place.

* nation{+}
* star{+}
* fleet{*}

| nation
| The organizational structure that allows individuals to act as a group. 
| - 
| 
* species{1}
* leader{1}

| species 
| A group of organisms being on the cusp to the stars.
| -
| -

| leader 
| A single individual massively influencing the actions of a species. Might be some kind of emperor or elected sovereign.

| star
| "A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star[(Wikipedia)]

* spectral class{1}
* planetary characteristics{1}
* colony{0..1}
* fleet{*}

| spectral class 
| 
* O and B (blue)
* A (white)
* F (green)
* G (yellow)
* K (orange)
* M (red)

According to the http://www.meixnerobservatorium.at/astronomie-allgemein-astronomy-popular/hertzsprung-russel-diagramm/[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram] F should rather be white/yellow instead of green. The spectral class of a star influences what kind of planets might orbiting it. Stars of class G and partially F and K have the highest likelihood for earth like planets.

| planetary characteristics
| Summarizes the overall characteristics of a solar system's planets. That means individual planets are not taken into account but rather an average value. The characteristics include e.g. environment, specials and size.

* nation{1}
* total production{1}
* scan radius{1}
* (selected) ship type{0..1}

| total production
| Planetary production is measured in BCs (billions of credits) and is a measure of a solar system’s overall production capacity.
| -
| -

| scan radius
| The area colonies and fleets are able to scan for foreign colonies and fleets. It is measured in parsecs.
| -
| -

| fleet
| A group of ships commanded by a nation. Is either orbiting a star or traveling through deep space. 
| - 
|
* nation{1}
* ship type --> count{+}
* star{0..1}

| ship type
| Type of a single space vessel. The speed is given in parsecs per turn. The type is either:

* scout (speed = 0.5, scan radius = 0.5, costs = 10)
* fighter (speed = 0.4, scan radius = 0.25, costs = 20)
* bomber (speed = 0.3, scan radius = 0.15, costs = 40)
* colony ship (speed = 0.25, scan radius = 0.5, costs = 80)
